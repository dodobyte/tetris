# Tetris

This is a Simple Tetris Game in Go and SDL2. It looks and plays like [smallbasic tetris](http://smallbasic.com/program/?TETRIS). I pretty much lifted everything but code.

I've written it in two evenings because the original one didn't have a pause button. So it can be buggy and the code is not very nice. Keep that in mind.

You need SDL2 and [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) binding to build it. If you just want to play, you can download binary distribution [here](http://dogankurt.com/tetris.zip).

Have fun!
